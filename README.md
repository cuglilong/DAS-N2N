# DAS-N2N
Code repository for paper "DAS-N2N: Machine learning Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) signal denoising without clean data" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08120).

At the moment, we have only provided a notebook to reproduce the results (figures) in the paper.

A notebook that demonstrates the training procedure for DAS-N2N using continuous DAS data will be uploaded once the data have been archived online (e.g., on IRIS).

If you would like further guidance on training a DAS-N2N model for your own data, please feel free to get in touch: \href{mailto:sacha.lapins@bristol.ac.uk}{sacha.lapins@bristol.ac.uk}
